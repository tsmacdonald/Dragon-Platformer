* Somewhat arbitrary walking and flapping animations.

* Player image is sometimes backwards. (Go right while flapping, turn left, flap->flapping image will face right)

* Enemies sometimes start in incorrect locations.

* Player sometimes starts outside of the level (and falls eternally)

* Using rects instead of bitmap masks for collisions makes for some frustrating deaths.

* Player sometimes can't jump from the very edge of a platform.

* Enemies sometimes take entirely too long to turn around after hitting a wall.

* Looking is jerky.

* Almost every image has non-transparent artifacts.

* 200pt powerup blends in to background (minor...hopefully there'll be a background change and it'll get fixed)

* Appropriate way to deal with player death (lives; restart level; earn new lives from points)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Needs:

* Put in the 1000/2000/5000/10-shot powerup images.

* Make about ten more enemies.

* More traps (electrified something; NOT fire; maybe some kind of ice thing)

* Background tiles

* Platform tiles

* A plot :P
